## Description
In this workshop, we will teach you the basics of WebVR development.
We're going to introduce you to the open source WebVR framework A-Frame and show you how to use it to bring virtual reality to the web.

After the workshop, you'll be able to build your first WebVR experiences.  

All you need to join is a Laptop and some experience in HTML. A basic knowledge of Javascript is helpful, but not needed.
Since we'll be using the online editor Glitch for this workshop, you won't need to install any software on your computer.
